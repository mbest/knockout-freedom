### **Binding Freedom** plugin for [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)

Ryan Niemeyer’s blog post [“Knockout.js Performance Gotcha #3 - All Bindings Fire Together”](http://www.knockmeout.net/2012/06/knockoutjs-performance-gotcha-3-all-bindings.html) very clearly describes how and why sibling bindings (multiple bindings on the same element) all update together. I discovered this problem in Knockout soon after I started developing with it and have come up with a few solutions since then:

* [A simple wrapper binding](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/wiki/Bindings---async) isolates a specific binding from its siblings by calling its `update` function within a `ko.computed` within the wrapper’s `init` function. Although this method does work in some cases, it fails in a few ways. First, the wrapped binding doesn’t get updates from observables that are accessed directly in the binding string. Second, the binding value isn’t inaccessible by other bindings through `allBindingAccessor` because it changes the name of the binding. Third, this method changes the run order of the bindings by making the *isolated* binding run first (because all `init` functions are run before all `update` functions).

* [My first fork of Knockout](https://github.com/mbest/knockout/tree/async_bindings) isolates sibling bindings by preprocessing the binding string so that each binding value is wrapped in a function, which is then unwrapped within the `valueAccessor` function. This works even better than the wrapper binding above, but also has problems. First, because the values are unwrapped in the `valueAccessor` functions, `allBindingAccessor` also has to unwrap the binding values, all of them--thus nullifying any benefit of having them wrapped. The solution for this requires modifying binding handlers to provide the binding name to `allBindingAccessor`. Second, it’s incompatible with custom binding providers that don’t wrap all binding values in functions. Third, it breaks top-level observable view models, which will no longer update any bindings.

* [My second fork of Knockout](https://github.com/mbest/knockout/tree/smart-binding) is much more ambitious than the first one and includes many other useful features and fixes. It uses a similar fix to the problem as my first fork, with some important changes. First, the function used to wrap binding values is tagged so that the `valueAccessor` functions can work without a wrapped value, which fixes the compatibility issue with custom binding providers. Second, it specifically supports observable view models (at the top or child levels). Tt still suffers from the `allBindingAccessor` compatibility issue for the same reasons as above. Also, since this fork includes so many changes to the Knockout code, many will be uncomfortable using it.

* This plugin, [Knockout-Freedom](https://github.com/mbest/knockout-freedom), is my latest solution to the linked-bindings problem. It is, I beleive, the best one yet, combining solutions from each of my previous attempts.
